# Security Features

This portfolio includes enterprise-level security features for the contact form functionality.

## üîí Security Implementations

### Backend Security (process_form.php)
- **CSRF Protection**: Session-based CSRF tokens prevent cross-site request forgery attacks
- **Email Header Injection Prevention**: Sanitizes email headers to prevent malicious header injection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation with length limits and format checking
- **Security Headers**: Implements security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
- **Safe Email Handling**: Uses structured headers and safe sender addresses
- **Error Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks

### Frontend Security (Contact.jsx)
- **CSRF Token Management**: Automatically fetches and includes CSRF tokens in form submissions
- **Client-side Validation**: Real-time validation that matches backend rules
- **Secure Communication**: Handles JSON responses and proper error states
- **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs are properly escaped and validated

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

1. **Dual Validation**: Both client and server-side validation ensure data integrity
2. **Rate Limiting Ready**: Structure supports easy addition of rate limiting
3. **Secure Headers**: Prevents common web vulnerabilities
4. **Input Sanitization**: All data is cleaned before processing
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Feedback**: Users get immediate validation feedback
- **Professional UX**: Loading states, success confirmations, and clear error messages
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and screen reader support
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works even if JavaScript fails
