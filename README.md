## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Animations**: Utilizes Framer Motion for smooth and engaging animations.
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Built atop a custom Tailwind design system that can easily support light and dark themes.
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags and structure optimized for search engines.
- **Custom Components**: Reusable and customizable React components.
- **Fast Loading**: Built with Vite for lightning-fast development and production builds.

### Theme Modes

The Tailwind-driven design tokens support two named themes that are referenced throughout the UI:

- `dark` – the high-contrast midnight palette showcased in the redesigned layout.
- `light` – a softer variant tuned for daylight viewing while preserving the same design tokens.

The current selection is stored in `localStorage` (via `react-hook-theme`) so the choice persists across reloads and sessions.

## Technologies

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **Custom Tailwind Design System**: A handcrafted set of tokens and components built with Tailwind CSS.
- **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)**: A powerful library for animations in React.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
